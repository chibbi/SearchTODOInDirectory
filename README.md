# SearchTODOInDirectory
This is a Java program, which searches every file of the given directory for "TODO:", to see what you still have to do.  
  
## Usage  
  Compile: ```javac main.java```
  run: ```java main /path/to/your/directory```
It works, somehow, it is just magic, if you are able to change ANYTHING without completly breaking it, pls message me, because i can't
